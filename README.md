  üíª Technology and Social Impact ‚öñÔ∏è
</h4>

<p align="center">
I am a firm believer that the advancement of technology, when done properly, can bring positive and meaningful change. This is why, professionally, I am in the tech industry - particularly within sectors where social impact is a driving force and mission.
<br><br>
With my enthusiasm for software development and aptitude in problem-solving, a career as a software engineer aligns with my faith in the potential of technology.
<br><br>
I gain great fulfillment taking part in the creation and in the development of tools that enable society to accomplish more and to move further beyond.
<br><br>
This is core to my career - the ambition to be involved in and to contribute in creating a better world.
