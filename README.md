# Hello World!

:wave: Hi, Iâ€™m @wkyoshida!

### Technology and Social Good

I am a firm believer that the advancement of technology, when done properly, can bring positive and impactful change to humankind. This is why, professionally, I am in the tech industry - particularly, within sectors where the social good is a driving force and mission.

With my enthusiasm for software development and aptitude in problem-solving, a career as a software engineer matches my faith in the potential of technology.

I gain great fulfillment by taking part in the creation and the development of tools that can enable society to accomplish more and move further beyond.

This is a core pillar to my career - the ambition to be involved in and to contribute in creating a better world.
